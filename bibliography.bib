	abstract = {The framework of normalizing flows provides a general strategy for flexible variational inference of posteriors over latent variables. We propose a new type of normalizing flow, inverse autoregressive flow (IAF), that, in contrast to earlier published flows, scales well to high-dimensional latent spaces. The proposed flow consists of a chain of invertible transformations, where each transformation is based on an autoregressive neural network. In experiments, we show that IAF significantly improves upon diagonal Gaussian approximate posteriors. In addition, we demonstrate that a novel type of variational autoencoder, coupled with IAF, is competitive with neural autoregressive models in terms of attained log-likelihood on natural images, while allowing significantly faster synthesis.},

We describe an approach for increasing the flexibility of an autoregressive model, based on modelling the random numbers that the model uses internally when generating data. By constructing a stack of autoregressive models, each modelling the random numbers of the next model in the stack, we obtain a type of normalizing flow suitable for density estimation, which we call Masked Autoregressive Flow. This type of flow is closely related to Inverse Autoregressive Flow and is a generalization of Real NVP. Masked Autoregressive Flow achieves state-of-the-art performance in a range of general-purpose density estimation tasks.},

	ABSTRACT = {The use of Project Gutenberg (PG) as a text corpus has been extremely popular in statistical analysis of language for more than 25 years. However, in contrast to other major linguistic datasets of similar importance, no consensual full version of PG exists to date. In fact, most PG studies so far either consider only a small number of manually selected books, leading to potential biased subsets, or employ vastly different pre-processing strategies (often specified in insufficient details), raising concerns regarding the reproducibility of published results. In order to address these shortcomings, here we present the Standardized Project Gutenberg Corpus (SPGC), an open science approach to a curated version of the complete PG data containing more than 50,000 books and more than     3 &times;  10 9      word-tokens. Using different sources of annotated metadata, we not only provide a broad characterization of the content of PG, but also show different examples highlighting the potential of SPGC for investigating language variability across time, subjects, and authors. We publish our methodology in detail, the code to download and process the data, as well as the obtained corpus itself on three different levels of granularity (raw text, timeseries of word tokens, and counts of words). In this way, we provide a reproducible, pre-processed, full-size version of Project Gutenberg as a new scientific resource for corpus linguistics, natural language processing, and information retrieval.},

@article{raghu2020,
	abstract = {Over the past few years, we have seen fundamental breakthroughs in core problems in machine learning, largely driven by advances in deep neural networks. At the same time, the amount of data collected in a wide array of scientific domains is dramatically increasing in both size and complexity. Taken together, this suggests many exciting opportunities for deep learning applications in scientific settings. But a significant challenge to this is simply knowing where to start. The sheer breadth and diversity of different deep learning techniques makes it difficult to determine what scientific problems might be most amenable to these methods, or which specific combination of methods might offer the most promising first approach. In this survey, we focus on addressing this central issue, providing an overview of many widely used deep learning models, spanning visual, sequential and graph structured data, associated tasks and different training methods, along with techniques to use deep learning with less data and better interpret these complex models --- two central considerations for many scientific use cases. We also include overviews of the full design process, implementation tips, and links to a plethora of tutorials, research summaries and open-sourced deep learning pipelines and pretrained models, developed by the community. We hope that this survey will help accelerate the use of deep learning across different scientific domains.},

	abstract = {This paper examines whether temporal difference methods for training connectionist networks, such as Sutton's TD($\lambda$) algorithm, can be successfully applied to complex real-world problems. A number of important practical issues are identified and discussed from a general theoretical perspective. These practical issues are then examined in the context of a case study in which TD($\lambda$) is applied to learning the game of backgammon from the outcome of self-play. This is apparently the first application of this algorithm to a complex non-trivial task. It is found that, with zero knowledge built in, the network is able to learn from scratch to play the entire game at a fairly strong intermediate level of performance, which is clearly better than conventional commercial programs, and which in fact surpasses comparable networks trained on a massive human expert data set. This indicates that TD learning may work better in practice than one would expect based on current theory, and it suggests that further analysis of TD methods, as well as applications in other complex domains, may be worth investigating.},

	abstract = {Image classification systems recently made a giant leap with the advancement of deep neural networks. However, these systems require an excessive amount of labeled data to be adequately trained. Gathering a correctly annotated dataset is not always feasible due to several factors, such as the expensiveness of the labeling process or difficulty of correctly classifying data, even for the experts. Because of these practical challenges, label noise is a common problem in real-world datasets, and numerous methods to train deep neural networks with label noise are proposed in the literature. Although deep neural networks are known to be relatively robust to label noise, their tendency to overfit data makes them vulnerable to memorizing even random noise. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the existence of label noise and develop counter algorithms to fade away its adverse effects to train deep neural networks efficiently. Even though an extensive survey of machine learning techniques under label noise exists, the literature lacks a comprehensive survey of methodologies centered explicitly around deep learning in the presence of noisy labels. This paper aims to present these algorithms while categorizing them into one of the two subgroups: noise model based and noise model free methods. Algorithms in the first group aim to estimate the noise structure and use this information to avoid the adverse effects of noisy labels. Differently, methods in the second group try to come up with inherently noise robust algorithms by using approaches like robust losses, regularizers or other learning paradigms.}

However, most of existing deep learning approaches are based on the framework of auto-encoder or sparse auto-encoder, which pose challenges for independent component analysis and fail to measure similarities between data spaces. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new strategy to achieve a better feature representation performance for transfer learning. There are several advantages in our method as follows: 1) The model of Stacked Reconstruction Independent Component Analysis (SRICA) is used to pursuit an optimal feature representation; 2) The label information is used by Logistic Regression Model to optimize representation features and the distance of distributions between domains is minimized by the method of KL-Divergence. Extensive experiments conducted on several image datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method compared with all competing state-of-the-art methods.}

	abstract = {Transfer learning usually utilizes the knowledge learned from the relative labeled source domain to promote the model performance in the unlabeled or few labeled target domain with different distribution. Most of the existing transfer learning methods aim to reduce the discrepancy of distributions between the source and target domains, but ignore the discriminative category information involved in the data from both domains in the process of knowledge transfer. To learn more discriminative feature representation in knowledge transfer, this paper integrates the transfer learning and metric learning into a unified framework and proposes a novel robust transfer learning based on geometric mean metric learning, namely Geometric Mean Transfer Learning (GMTL). GMTL uses weighted geometric mean metric learning to model the intra-class distance and the inter-class similarity. In the meantime, the marginal distributions and conditional distributions of the source and target domains are jointly adapted. Moreover, according to the natures of the datasets in different tasks, we dynamically combine the discriminative modeling and domain adaption to make the proposed model more robust. We assign different weights to the intra-class distance and the inter-class similarity in metric learning and different weights to marginal distribution adaption and conditional distribution adaption, respectively. Finally, the solution to the objective function is converted to the problem of finding a point on the geodesic joining two points on the Riemannian manifold, which is very simple and direct. Extensive experiments are conducted on six datasets widely adopted in transfer learning to verify the superiority of our proposed GMTL over existing state-of-the-art transfer learning methods.}

Here, we propose a method, i.e. incremental moment matching (IMM), to resolve this problem. IMM incrementally matches the moment of the posterior distribution of the neural network which is trained on the first and the second task, respectively. To make the search space of posterior parameter smooth, the IMM procedure is complemented by various transfer learning techniques including weight transfer, L2-norm of the old and the new parameter, and a variant of dropout with the old parameter. We analyze our approach on a variety of datasets including the MNIST, CIFAR-10, Caltech-UCSD-Birds, and Lifelog datasets. The experimental results show that IMM achieves state-of-the-art performance by balancing the information between an old and a new network.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces LMFAO (Layered Multiple Functional Aggregate Optimization), an in-memory optimization and execution engine for batches of aggregates over the input database. The primary motivation for this work stems from the observation that for a variety of analytics over databases, their data-intensive tasks can be decomposed into group-by aggregates over the join of the input database relations. We exemplify the versatility and competitiveness of LMFAO for a handful of widely used analytics: learning ridge linear regression, classification trees, regression trees, and the structure of Bayesian networks using Chow-Liu trees; and data cubes used for exploration in data warehousing. LMFAO consists of several layers of logical and code optimizations that systematically exploit sharing of computation, parallelism, and code specialization. We conducted two types of performance benchmarks. In experiments with four datasets, LMFAO outperforms by several orders of magnitude on one hand, a commercial database system and MonetDB for computing batches of aggregates, and on the other hand, TensorFlow, Scikit, R, and AC/DC for learning a variety of models over databases.},

	abstract = {Integrated solutions for analytics over relational databases are of great practical importance as they avoid the costly repeated loop data scientists have to deal with on a daily basis: select features from data residing in relational databases using feature extraction queries involving joins, projections, and aggregations; export the training dataset defined by such queries; convert this dataset into the format of an external learning tool; and train the desired model using this tool. These integrated solutions are also a fertile ground of theoretically fundamental and challenging problems at the intersection of relational and statistical data models.This article introduces a unified framework for training and evaluating a class of statistical learning models over relational databases. This class includes ridge linear regression, polynomial regression, factorization machines, and principal component analysis. We show that, by synergizing key tools from database theory such as schema information, query structure, functional dependencies, recent advances in query evaluation algorithms, and from linear algebra such as tensor and matrix operations, one can formulate relational analytics problems and design efficient (query and data) structure-aware algorithms to solve them.This theoretical development informed the design and implementation of the AC/DC system for structure-aware learning. We benchmark the performance of AC/DC against R, MADlib, libFM, and TensorFlow. For typical retail forecasting and advertisement planning applications, AC/DC can learn polynomial regression models and factorization machines with at least the same accuracy as its competitors and up to three orders of magnitude faster than its competitors whenever they do not run out of memory, exceed 24-hour timeout, or encounter internal design limitations.},

We show that conditioning Tacotron on this learned embedding space results in synthesized audio that matches the prosody of the reference signal with fine time detail even when the reference and synthesis speakers are different. Additionally, we show that a reference prosody embedding can be used to synthesize text that is different from that of the reference utterance. We define several quantitative and subjective metrics for evaluating prosody transfer, and report results with accompanying audio samples from single-speaker and 44-speaker Tacotron models on a prosody transfer task.} }
