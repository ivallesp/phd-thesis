\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I have always had in mind the idea of pursuing a PhD program. However, after finishing my bachelor degree, I found great professional opportunities that I could not overlook. Nonetheless, I never lost the esire to continue my educational journey.  Thus, a  few years later, I found the fantastic opportunity to start a part-time PhD at Universitat de València. Being a part-time PhD student at the \textit{Intelligent Data Analysis Laboratory} of the \textit{Universitat de València} was lots of fun, and one of the best decisions I could have made.  

I would like to start by sincerely expressing my gratitude to Emilio Soria-Olivas, PhD my advisor. First of all, thank you for instilling your passion in artificial intelligence with me. Your encouragement and guidance has been a key factor in the development of this thesis, without which this work could never have been possible. I would also like to thank all the members of the Intelligent Data Analysis Laboratory of the University of Valencia, many of whom directly collaborated and reviewed my work: Antonio-José Serrano-López, Ph.D., Marcelino  Martínez-Sober, Ph.D., Juan Gómez-Sanchis, Ph.D., Fernando Mateo-Jiménez, Ph.D and Joan Vila-Francés, Ph.D. 

On the professional side, I would like to thank all the \textit{Alexa TTS} research group, for accepting me into their family. Thanks to all the people who directly collaborated to my contributions to the speech generation field: Dr. Roberto Barra-Chicote, Ph.D., Dr. Jasha Droppo, Ph.D., Mr. Julian Roth, M.Sc. and Mr. Grzegorz Beringer, M.Sc. Special mention to Dr. Roberto Barra-Chicote, Ph.D., my mentor, for all his guidance and support, and for continuously boosting my motivation and helping me be a better scientist.

Finally, and more importantly, I would like to acknowledge my family, especially my partner María, my brother David and my parents Reme and Ignacio, for all the unconditional support during these years, in all its modalities. This work would not have been possible without your love.
